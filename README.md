# Web Design Challenge
Visualization Dashboard Website (Latitude)

For this assignment I created a visualization dashboard website using weather data.
This dashboard includes a landing page where we can see a comparison of plots, a page containing the data used to build the plots, and individual pages for each plot, and a means by which we can navigate between these pages.

## Requirements
The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:

A landing page containing:

- an explanation of the project
- links to each visualizations page
- a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization


Four visualization pages, each with:

- a descriptive title and heading tag
- the plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison
- aparagraph describing the plot and its significance


A "Comparisons" page that:

- contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them
- uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations

The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.



A "Data" page that:

- displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations

- the table must be a bootstrap table component

The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML.



The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:

Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
Provides two more text links on the right: "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.
Is responsive (using media queries).
